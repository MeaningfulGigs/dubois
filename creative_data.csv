Designed to resemble a Mobius strip, which is a perfect mathematical reflection of seamless synergy, the logo represents the perfect inter-relationship between consonance and its most important asset; its clients and their businesses. Consonance has a deep commitment to Africa; using an experienced, intellectually independent, and honest team to assess and invest in various financially, environmentally, and socially sustainable market opportunities in Africa for Africans.\nGeneza took this to heart, choosing 2 distinct color hues to symbolize this commitment to African entrepreneurs and enterprises. A vibrant Reddish-Orange synonymous with the iron-rich Sub-Saharan soil and a solid black to represents the unique African melanin-rich skin. We aptly named these eye-catching hues Consonance Clay and Consonance Black, serving as the Brand’s primary colors and giving Consonance a visually appealing outlook that reflects its roots and its focus.

Boot X is entering the proof of concept phase partnering with a local grassroots football club to help them raise funds for the building of a new artificial football pitch. Although the proof of concept will focus on Football Boots, the longer-term vision is to open the platform up to list all football-based equipment and be a transferable model that can be used across different grassroots sports.\n\nOur mission is to make buying used football boots and equipment not only acceptable but a desirable thing to do as well as a fulfilling experience. We want the users of the service to feel like they are getting a good quality product from a premium brand and create something that becomes a viable alternative option to buying new. We feel this is possible following the lead of brands like Back Market and Depop that have managed to redefine this category.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nBoot X requires the design of a brand logo that will have focused usage in the early phases of this project. Boot X stock will initially only be listed on Instagram and at this proof of concept phase it is unlikely there will be any further digital touchpoints. Ideally, we would have a logomark that is usable as a watermark on the images of what is posted on Instagram and if there is any continuation of the logo mark that can form a visual language that can be overlaid on Instagram posts that would be desirable.

The goal was to create a safe and inclusive community that fosters conversations around mental health issues. To achieve this, I focused on capturing the reader's emotions and promoting a sense of belonging. \n\nI began by designing a logo that served as a randomizer for generating discussion topics, going beyond common mental health issues to include day-to-day occurrences. Typography played a crucial role in expressing inclusivity, with different weights representing gender-specific conversations. \n\nOne of the highlights of this project was working on the posters, where I utilized the logo's randomizer to generate icons and paired them with appropriate typography. This approach allowed for a consistent visual language across different cultures and languages. \n\nThe merch bags were designed to be visually appealing and foster first conversations. By using a fluid type system and expressive icons, we created a distinctively urban and modern visual language. This approach provided flexibility to create unique designs for different bags without relying solely on the logo for identification. \n\nAnother important aspect was developing the brand imagery. I created custom presets to apply specific settings to images, ensuring they aligned with the brand story. The emphasis was on professional and human-focused imagery, utilizing portrait photos and community shots. \n\nSocial media played a vital role in the project, serving as a major touchpoint for new members and the public. I modified the icons for Instagram highlight covers and collaborated with AR designers to create interactive Instagram filters. Additionally, I provided clear guidelines for the YouTube channel's design, combining brand imagery and typography.\n\nThe impact of the visual system was significant, as it created a cohesive and engaging experience across various touchpoints.

This step helped to increase user engagement and ensure compliance with necessary tasks\u200b.\n\nAddressing Missing APIs: To reduce the volume of calls to our customer support team related to discrepancies in the number of APIs and wallet balances displayed on user dashboards, I implemented a modal with a five-second countdown. This feature reminded users of the environment they were logged into, which significantly reduced related customer support calls\u200b.\n\nImproving the Filter: I reworked the filter feature, which was a vital part of our application, by collapsing it into a single modal.
